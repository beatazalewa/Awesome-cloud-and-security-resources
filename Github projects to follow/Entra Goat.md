## Entra Goat

EntraGoat is a deliberately vulnerable Microsoft Entra ID infrastructure designed to simulate real-world identity security misconfigurations and attack vectors. EntraGoat introduces intentional vulnerabilities in your environment to provide a realistic learning platform for security professionals. It features multiple privilege escalation paths and focuses on black-box attack methodologies.

EntraGoat uses PowerShell scripts and Microsoft Graph APIs to deploy vulnerable configurations in your Entra ID tenant. This gives users complete control over the learning environment while maintaining isolation from production systems.
