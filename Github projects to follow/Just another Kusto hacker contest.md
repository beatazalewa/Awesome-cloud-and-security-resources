## Just another Kusto hacker ("JAKH") contest!

The challenge is to write a Kusto query that outputs the string "Just another Kusto hacker". The query can be as simple or as complex as you like, as long as it is self-contained and can run on any Fabric EventHouse or Azure Data Explorer cluster.

You can use a free Azure Data Explorer cluster or the Azure Data Explorer Emulator for testing.

Participants will have the opportunity to vote on the most creative and innovative queries across multiple categories, and the winners will be publicly recognized for their efforts!
