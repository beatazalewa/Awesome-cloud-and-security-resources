## KQLIntel - From Unstructured Threat Intel to Actionable KQL Queries in Seconds

KQLIntel is a powerful, browser-based tool designed to bridge the gap between unstructured threat intelligence reports and actionable Kusto Query Language (KQL) queries. It leverages the power of modern Large Language Models (LLMs) to analyze threat reports from URLs or raw text, intelligently extract Indicators of Compromise (IOCs), and automatically generate KQL queries ready for threat hunting in Microsoft Sentinel and other security platforms.

The tool is designed by Varshil Desai for security analysts, threat hunters, and incident responders who need to quickly operationalize threat intelligence without manual parsing and query creation.
